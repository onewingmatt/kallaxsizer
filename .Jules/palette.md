## 2026-03-29 - [Keyboard Accessibility for Custom Components]
**Learning:** Interactive elements rendered as 'div' tags (like the Kallax cubes) must be made keyboard-accessible using 'role="button"', 'tabindex="0"', and keydown listeners for 'Enter' and 'Space'. Without these, keyboard-only users cannot interact with key features of the application.
**Action:** Always check for custom interactive elements and apply standard ARIA roles and keyboard listeners. Use 'focus-visible' CSS to provide clear visual feedback.

## 2025-05-14 - [Standardizing Keyboard Accessibility for Monolithic UI]
**Learning:** In a monolithic HTML file with custom-rendered components (divs, table cells), consistent focus indicators via ':focus-visible' and standardized keydown handlers for 'Enter'/'Space' are essential for parity with native interactive elements. Screen readers also require 'aria-expanded' states for collapsible sections to maintain situational awareness.
**Action:** Apply global ':focus-visible' rules for '[role="button"]' and implement reusable 'onkeydown' listeners that match 'onclick' functionality for all custom interactive elements. Ensure state-changing interactions update their corresponding ARIA attributes immediately.

## 2025-05-15 - [Accessible Table Sorting]
**Learning:** For sortable tables, `th` elements should use `aria-sort` ('ascending', 'descending', 'none') and `aria-label` to communicate state and intent to screen readers. Relying only on visual arrows (like ▲/▼) is insufficient. Keyboard users also need `tabindex="0"` and support for `Enter`/`Space` to trigger sorting.
**Action:** Always pair visual sort indicators with `aria-sort` updates and ensure headers are keyboard-focusable and interactive.
