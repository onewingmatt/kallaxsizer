## 2026-03-29 - [Keyboard Accessibility for Custom Components]
**Learning:** Interactive elements rendered as 'div' tags (like the Kallax cubes) must be made keyboard-accessible using 'role="button"', 'tabindex="0"', and keydown listeners for 'Enter' and 'Space'. Without these, keyboard-only users cannot interact with key features of the application.
**Action:** Always check for custom interactive elements and apply standard ARIA roles and keyboard listeners. Use 'focus-visible' CSS to provide clear visual feedback.

## 2025-05-14 - [Standardizing Keyboard Accessibility for Monolithic UI]
**Learning:** In a monolithic HTML file with custom-rendered components (divs, table cells), consistent focus indicators via ':focus-visible' and standardized keydown handlers for 'Enter'/'Space' are essential for parity with native interactive elements. Screen readers also require 'aria-expanded' states for collapsible sections to maintain situational awareness.
**Action:** Apply global ':focus-visible' rules for '[role="button"]' and implement reusable 'onkeydown' listeners that match 'onclick' functionality for all custom interactive elements. Ensure state-changing interactions update their corresponding ARIA attributes immediately.

## 2026-05-02 - [Standard Keyboard Submission for Forms]
**Learning:** In a form-like interface where the primary action is triggered by a button, users instinctively expect the 'Enter' key to submit the data. For text inputs not wrapped in a semantic 'form', explicit 'keydown' listeners are required to trigger the corresponding button's click event, maintaining a standard and efficient user workflow.
**Action:** Always ensure text inputs have 'Enter' key listeners that trigger their associated primary action buttons.
